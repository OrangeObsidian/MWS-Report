# Summary of Findings

The first objective of this report describes the available literature on cumulative impacts to water
quality in the Upper Coppermine River Basin, NWT. Results show the chemistry of the soft,
oligotrophic, shield lakes, characteristic of the area, can be vulnerable to even slight natural and
anthropogenic disturbances (Moiseenko and Gashkina, 2009). Already, localized natural resource
development has been shown to cause chemical changes in the water in and around Lac de Gras
(Stantec, 2015). Road expansion has the potential to alter the major ions, conductivity and pH of
nearby lakes. Regionally, climate change is showing its ability to influence natural processes on a
larger scale. Air temperature warming has been observed to be triggering increased active layer
thickness, further driving permafrost thaw and slumping in Baker Creek, NWT which serves as a
potential future example of changes in the Coppermine under increasing climate change. Freshlyexposed
soils and glacial sediments, rich in major ions and trace elements, are being eroded and
transported to the unspoiled Shield lakes via overland runoff during peak summer flow (Houben et al.,
2016). The behaviour of such compounds in these lakes is not well understood. Increased DOC and N
may increase primary production or, perhaps, sedimentation will intervene. Alternatively, the
vastness of the watershed will simply dilute the chemical disturbances over time. The lack of specific
research on water quality in the Upper Coppermine serves as a call for action to invest in better
understanding the short and long term results of cumulative effects.

Results from the second objective provide a detailed analysis of water quality parameters at Daring
Lake, Desteffany Lake, Lac de Gras and Rocknest Lake. The mean and median values of all parameters
in the Upper Coppermine are below the CCME Freshwater Aquatic Life Water Quality Guidelines.
Median total phosphorus levels indicate the lakes are ultra-oligotrophic to oligotrophic. All of the
lakes show a median pH between 6.5 and 7.5 indicating that they are circumneutral. All the lakes are
low in ions and show spatial homogeneity. An average mean hardness of 9 mg/L classifies the Upper
Coppermine lakes as soft water. Much of the data is slightly skewed to the right, as is typical of water
quality data. Rocknest Lake likely owes its higher median hardness, alkalinity, barium, pH, TDS, DOC,
total nitrogen, calcium and magnesium to its location below the treeline and in the Bear Geological
Province, a different geological setting with more vegetation and higher erosion rates, as compared to
other studied lakes in the Upper Coppermine. Lac de Gras and Desteffany Lake have similar water
quality characteristics and concentrations. Many of the water quality parameters show significant
temporal trends at Lac de Gras and Desteffany Lake, which is in contrast to Daring Lake and Rocknest
Lake where there are fewer significant changes in water quality parameters. Increasing major ion
concentrations in Na (by 419% at Lac de Gras and 174% at Desteffany) and DOC (by 9% at Lac de Gras
and 26% at Desteffany) are warning signs of potential active layer thickening and thermokarst
slumping (Burd et al. 2018 and Kokelj, 2009). Increasing conductivity (by 94% at Lac de Gras and 45%
at Desteffany) is a possible sign of impacts from road dust (Zhu et al. 2019), or more likely, the treated
mine effluent. As well, increasing strontium concentrations (by 223% at Lac de Gras and 103% at
Desteffany) and pH (by 5% at Lac de Gras and 6% at Desteffany) are potentially a sign of impacts from
upstream effluent from diamond mine operations (Deton’ Cho Stantec, 2015). Therefore, at these two
lakes, there is evidence of cumulative effects to water quality. Daring Lake appears to be a good
choice for a reference lake in the tundra environment above the treeline in the Upper Coppermine. Its
small interquartile ranges (Appendix B2) and lack of significant temporal trends suggest that it has
undergone little transformation and impacts from disturbance over the period of record.

Finally, the third objective provides a preliminary evaluation of the Ecofish cumulative effect indexing
tool. The results from the tool are similar to the results from the analysis of nearly 20 years of water
quality data at Daring Lake, Desteffany Lake and Lac de Gras. Lac de Gras and Desteffany show higher
cumulative effects, mainly contributed by anthropogenic disturbance in their sub-basin. The actual
data supports the tool’s interpretation of Desteffany and Lac de Gras with a high number of
significant temporal trends and significant increases in anthropogenic related parameters, such as
strontium and conductance. Daring Lake is predicted to have low cumulative effect risk and its
baseline data supports this with few temporal trends and a lack of changing anthropogenic related
parameters. Future work with the tool should include layers that address permafrost thaw, slumping,
and forest fires in the natural disturbance section and land cover and surficial geology in the
landscape vulnerability section.

**Towards a Solution**

Going forward, NWT CIMP will conduct a three year project assessing the water quality of at least 30
lakes in the Daring Lake sub-basin. Sampling results can be compared against the calculated baselines
from this report to determine whether exceedances are occurring. Exceedances can be used to gauge the level of cumulative effects occurring and then compared against the cumulative effect (CE)
indexing tool’s predictions. Eventually, it is the hope that the CE indexing tool will be validated and
capable of being used across the NWT.

Recommendations for NWT CIMP include the inclusion of traditional knowledge in water quality
baseline studies in the Upper Coppermine because of the large proportion of Indigenous
stakeholders. As well it is suggested that strontium, chloride, sodium, pH and conductivity are closely
monitored and used as an indicator for anthropogenic disturbance, and major ions and DOC are
closely examined. Finally, a permafrost slump metric should be added to the natural disturbance
category of the CE indexing tool to better identify natural disturbances.

As climate change, and increased development continues to change the natural environment in the
north, understanding cumulative effects is becoming more and more vital to maintaining northern
ecosystems. Ultimately, the information provided in this report will help the NWT CIMP, understand
cumulative effects to water quality in the Upper Coppermine and other areas of the NWT, better
detect exceedances of ambient baseline thresholds, and finally, help calibrate a cumulative effect
indexing tool. The better understanding of cumulative effects to water quality in the Upper
Coppermine provided in this report advances progress of NWT CIMP’s inspiring vision to “watch and
understand the land so it can be used respectfully forever”.
