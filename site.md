This section describes the geographical and geological attributes of the Upper Coppermine, as well as the anthropogenic and natural activity that influence and control its water quality. 

**Geography and Geology**

The Coppermine River basin is a transboundary basin, with its headwaters in Lac du Sauvage, NWT. Its waters generally flow northward through a tundra lake-dominated system including, for example, Lac de Gras, Desteffany Lake, Lake Providence, Point Lake, Redrock Lake, and Rocknest Lake, before forming the primary river system of the Coppermine River, which drains into the Coronation Gulf in Nunavut (Stantec, 2015). Its drainage area is approximately 50,800 km2 (Wedel et al., 1988). 

The majority of the basin straddles the treeline: towards the west is sparse boreal forest, and towards the east the basin transitions into subarctic-arctic tundra (Pienitz et al., 1997). The basin exhibits dramatic north-south change in mean annual air temperature and precipitation owing to the position of the strong arctic front, and variation in albedo across the change from boreal forest to tundra (Pienitz et al., 1997). According to Environment Canada historical data from gauges near the Ekati diamond mine, NWT (in the south of the basin) and Kugluktuk, NU (in the north of the basin), the mean annual air temperature is -10.8oC in the north and -8.4oC in the south. The average total annual precipitation is 236.4 mm in the north and 265.0 mm in the south. Generally, the lakes are ice-covered from November to April, with spring freshet occurring between May and June (Stantec, 2015). Streamflow and lake levels in the Upper Coppermine typically gradually increase through the spring freshet to peak flows in July and sometimes a second peak in September due to late-summer rainfall events.

Physiographically, the basin is divided into three regions: the north (Bear Geological Province), south (Slave Geological Province) and northwest (Arctic Platform) (Wedel et al., 1998) (Figure 1). The bedrock is thought to be the primary control on variations in water quantity and quality properties such as flow, pH, alkalinity and turbidity (Wedel et al., 1988). The Bear Geological Province (BGP) is comprised predominantly of metamorphosed sedimentary rocks that lead to higher rates of erosion than the weather resistant igneous rocks of the Slave Geological Province. The Slave Geological Province (SGP) is composed mainly of granitic plutons with folded supracrustal belts (Wedel et al., 1988). The Upper Coppermine is located entirely in the SGP and contains many glacial depression the lake-dominated system in the Upper Coppermine controls the basin’s hydrology; the result is a dampened hydrograph with often low discharge in response to precipitation events (IAAND, 1998).  The Coppermine is predominantly within the zone of continuous permafrost, with the exception of discontinuous permafrost in the southwestern portion (Penitz et al., 1997). The southwestern portion is somewhat analogous to Baker Creek, a well-studied Taiga Shield catchment approximately 300km to the southwest of Lac de Gras, where “glaciolacustrine clays, outwash, and organic deposits are typically underlain by permafrost, whereas bedrock and well‐drained glaciofluvial sands are typically unfrozen” (Spence et al., 2015, p.115). Hydrologically, the Upper Coppermine can be segmented into Yamba Lake sub-basin and the Lac de Gras sub-basin (Figure 1.b). 

**Water Quality**

According to Stantec’s report in 2015, which used Government of the Northwest Territories Environment and Natural Resources (GNWT ENR) water quality data, lakes in the Upper Coppermine are generally oligotrophic, circumneutral, and soft with low conductivity, nutrients, and buffering capacity. Dominant cations are Ca+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+. Dominant anions are HCO3-, SO42-, and Cl- (Stantec, 2015). Spatially, the lake water quality is generally homogenous, while temporal trends at Desteffany Lake and Lac de Gras show increases in pH, conductivity, hardness, dissolved calcium, dissolved magnesium, chloride, strontium and molybdenum (Stantec, 2015). The low level of parameters in the granitic bedrock lakes is typical of a shield environment (Penitz et al., 1997). Both Stantec (2015) and Penitz et al. (1997) indicate that bedrock, soil, vegetation type, climate and glacial drift age are the main controls on water quality in the Coppermine River basin (Penitz et al., 1997). Areas with supracrustal (metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic bedrock) outcroppings tend to have higher pH (Penitz et al., 1997). Lakes in younger glacial drifts have higher conductivities and are strongly enriched in major ions compared to more mature drifts (Penitz et al., 1997). Outcroppings of these geological features occur throughout the Upper Coppermine, however, their effects on water quality have only been noticed in small lakes. Tundra lakes exhibit higher anion concentrations than boreal lakes (Penitz et al., 1997). DIC and DOC show latitudinal gradients, decreasing as latitude increases (Penitz et al., 1997). As well, DOC is higher in boreal lakes. Overall, lakes in the Upper Coppermine seem to be controlled predominantly by bedrock, vegetation and climate, and show a small spatial range in variation of water quality parameters (Penitz et al., 1997). 

**Cumulative Effect Drivers**

Cumulative effects in the Upper Coppermine include both anthropogenic and natural drivers. Potential anthropogenic drivers of cumulative effects in the Upper Coppermine include diamond mining, base metal mining, road building and recreation (Stantec, 2015). Two diamond mines, Ekati and Diavik, have been operating in close proximity to Lac de Gras, near the headwaters of the Coppermine River, since 1998 and 2003 respectively (Stantec, 2015).
Together, these mines have been discharging treated waste water, which ultimately flows to Lac de Gras. Effluent discharge began with the Ekati mine in 1999 (Zajdlik, 2016). A study by Deton’ Cho Stantec in 2015, for the GNWT, showed there was an increase in several water chemistry parameters including Ca+, Mg2+, SO42- and Sr2+ concentration between the years 2000 and 2013. Further, St-Gelais et al. (2018) noticed increasing nitrogen and a change in the make-up of phytoplankton communities in lakes affected by the effluent sourced from nitrogen-rich explosive residue used at the Ekati diamond mine. 
A future Ekati mine expansion known as the Jay Project is a planned open pit mine near Lac de Sauvage, headwaters of the Coppermine (Stantec, 2015). Base metal exploration is also expected to increase in the Upper Coppermine area (Stantec, 2015).  Along with resource development comes road building such as the proposed advancement of the Slave Geological Province Access Corridor, which will open up more of the territory to natural resource exploration and development. No studies have been identified regarding road building impacts to water quality in the Upper Coppermine, however, examples from analogous geographical areas can help us to understand possible outcomes. From research into the impacts of the Dempster Highway in northern Yukon and NWT on lake water quality, Zhu et al. (2019) showed how deepening of the active layer adjacent to the highway has acidified lakes near Eagle Plains, while road dust has increased major ion concentration in lakes within 1 km of the highway. 
One of the most significant natural drivers of cumulative effects in the Upper Coppermine is climate change. Cohen et al. (2019) described that, according to Canada’s Changing Climate Report, average temperature in the Northwest Territories has increased 2.3oC between 1948 and 2016, nearly three times the mean warming rate of the earth. Climate change-related disturbances in subarctic regions, including the Upper Coppermine, are permafrost thaw-related landscape change, increased forest fires, warming mean water temperatures, and changing hydrological seasons. These disturbances have the potential to impact water quality in these regions. 

Water quality monitoring is critical to understanding and predicting the potential cumulative effects of these anthropogenic activities and natural disturbances.
