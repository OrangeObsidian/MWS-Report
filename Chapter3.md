# 3.0. Chapter 3 – Evaluation of the Ecofish Research Ltd. Cumulative Effect Indexing Tool

**3.1. Summary**

Ecofish Research Ltd. developed a water quality cumulative effect indexing tool for NWT CIMP. This
tool was developed to help select sites where water quality monitoring would be most beneficial to
understanding cumulative effects to water quality in a given region. For the next three years (2020-
2022), NWT CIMP will use the tool for a research project monitoring cumulative effects to water
quality in the Upper Coppermine River Basin. The project first uses the tool to categorize lakes in the
Upper Coppermine as low, medium or high cumulative effect risk by combing several remote sensing
metrics. Secondly, the tool uses the Halton Iterative Partitioning (HIP) method to remotely select lakes
greater than 1km (so that they can be accessed and sampled in a float or ski plane) in length throughout the basin
or sub-basin to be used in the monitoring program. Eventually, data from this three year water quality
sampling program of 30 lakes in the Daring Lake sub-basin will be used to fully validate the tool. The
first monitoring campaign took place in July 2020. The ultimate goal is a validated cumulative effect
tool that can be applied across the Northwest Territories to efficiently determine where monitoring
should be directed.

Prior to the monitoring campaign and collection of new water quality data, a first evaluation of the
tool can be undertaken using existing data, the same data analysed in Section 2.0 of this report. These
data were collected by Environment and Natural Resources – Water Management and Monitoring
Division (ENR-WMMD) for their long term water quality network. Sites used in this evaluation are
Daring Lake, Desteffany Lake and Lac de Gras. Observed data from these sites can be compared
against the tool’s prediction. Rocknest Lake was not used in the evaluation because it is outside of the
cumulative effect indexing tool’s borders.

Results from the tool predict low cumulative effect risk for Desteffany and Daring Lake and high risk
for Lac de Gras. The tool also predicts low risk in all natural disturbance metrics in all three lakes,
except for a medium water area change at Lac de Gras. Most of the risk comes from anthropogenic
disturbance. The observed results echo the tools predictions such that Lac de Gras shows the most
consistent change in parameters over the last 20 years in parameters constant with anthropogenic
disturbance. Desteffany Lake is rated low due to its high flushing rate, however, the observed data
would suggest a medium risk based on its significant increasing trends. Future recommendations for
the tool would be adding a permafrost slump metric to the natural disturbance category and looking
into the application of the vulnerability category.

**3.2. Development of the site selection tool**

The cumulative effect indexing portion of the tool was developed by Ecofish using publicly available
GIS data layers (Ecofish, 2020). It uses cumulative effect (CE) metrics from three categories. Natural
disturbances include wetting and drying indices, greening and browning indices, and total absolute
water surface area change. Anthropogenic disturbances include, distance downstream from disturbance, disturbance footprint density and road density. Finally, landscape vulnerability was
determined using a flushing rate index, which is the ratio of lake surface area to contributing area.

The greening and browning index is a measure of long term rates of greening or browning using
Landsat 5 imagery (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trends) from 1985-2010. The
wetting and drying uses the same methodology as greening and browning, however, Normalized
Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used instead. Water change percentage uses Landsat data from
1985-2010 sourced from the Global Water Surface Explorer. It compares the area of the changed area
against the entire area of the basin. Therefore, a high value indicates a larger disturbed area, most
likely caused by a natural disturbance. The disturbance footprint measures the area of anthropogenic
disturbance (ex. mine sites) in the upstream drainage area compared to the total basin area. The road
density metric measures road length in the upstream drainage area and divides this by the total basin
drainage area. Vulnerability was determined based on the lake size, compared to the upstream
drainage area. It is based on the idea that smaller lakes will be flushed and larger lakes will take longer
to expel contaminants.

The results are then rolled up into a 1 (low), 2 (medium) or 3 (high) ranking. Ranking thresholds are
determined by the 33rd and 67th percentiles or where established thresholds already exist. The next
step is to, roll up the metrics into one value that represents the CE risk for each lake. Three rules are
used in rolling up the three categories. First, if a lake scored high in any natural or anthropogenic
metric, it scores high over all. Second, if a lake scored medium in any natural or anthropogenic metric,
it scores medium overall. Third, if a lake has a low vulnerability rating and is not high in both natural
and anthropogenic disturbances, then the overall score is reduced by one. The predicted risk
categories for Daring, Destefany and Lac de Gras from the tool are: Low (Daring), Low (Desteffany) and High (Lac de Gras) (Table 8). Natural disturbances are all low (1) for all three lakes, except for
increased wetting (2) at Lac de Gras. Anthropogenic disturbances are low at Daring (1), and increased
at Desteffany (2) and Lac de Gras (2).

**3.3. Methodology**

First, an analysis of the tool’s CE parameters was conducted for each lake. Second, the tool’s results
were compared against the observed water quality data. The baseline analysis from section 2.0 was
compared to the prediction of the CE tool for evaluation. The number of significant trends was used
to categorize the lakes into low, medium or high cumulative effect risk. A similar statistical threshold
designation to the tool was used: <33% parameters with significant trends is low CE, 33.3%-66.6% is
medium CE, and >66.6% is high CE (Table 9). For example, if >66.6% of parameters showed long-term
significant changes over the lake’s history, it is considered to have been impacted to a high degree
from disturbances. The lake categories based on the observed water quality were then compared to
the categories predicted by the tool.

**3.4. Results**

Predicted natural disturbances are low (1) for all three lakes, except for increased wetting (2) at Lac
de Gras. It can therefore be inferred, that based on the tool’s parameters, the tool predicts there has
been little natural disturbance owing to climate change at these three lakes. Further teasing out
natural disturbance should involve more detailed metrics such as slumping and surficial geology, since
they were outlined as important earlier in this report (section 1.0).

Anthropogenic disturbances are low at Daring Lake (1), and increased at Desteffany Lake(2) and Lac
de Gras (2). The difference is most likely owing to the two active diamond mines in the Lac de Gras
sub-basin and the accompanying road networks (Figure 10). Currently, very few anthropogenic
disturbances are present in the Yamba sub-basin, however, the proposed all season Slave Geological
Province Road to Resources may increase Daring Lake’s anthropogenic metric in the future.

The lake vulnerability is low at Daring (1) and Desteffany (1) and high at Lac de Gras (3). Differences in
lake vulnerability are a result of lake size and lake contributing area. The large lake area of Lac de Gras
(568 km2) and relatively small contributing area indicates that the storage capacity is likely large and
flushing rate small, perhaps resulting in a storage of nutrients and other water constituents.

The observed CE categories are similar to the tool’s predicted categories (Table 9). Assuming that
significant changes over time in water quality parameters are indicators of cumulative effects, Daring
is low and Desteffany and Lac de Gras are medium. It should be noted also that the majority of annual
median trends at Daring were found to be insignificant when analyzed for linear regression and
ultimately further supports a lack of cumulative effect evidence at Daring. Exceedance percentages
are highest at Daring most likely because the baseline is ambient and includes temporal trends.
Therefore, the IQR is smaller at Daring and exceedances are more likely. It is expected that future
monitoring will begin to show higher exceedance percentages in Desteffany and Lac de Gras, and less at Daring. In the future, observed exceedances and trends can be used to calibrate the tool’s
predictions.

Furthermore, similar to the tool, the most significant increasing trends in parameters reflect
anthropogenic activity in the basin (strontium and conductivity) such as diamond mining and road
building. Strontium increased by 223% at Lac de Gras and 103% at Desteffany. Conductivity increased
by 94% at Lac de Gras and 45% at Desteffany.

**3.5. Discussion and Conclusion**

The results from the cumulative effect index tool developed by Ecofish Research Ltd. produces similar
results to the analysis of nearly 20 years of water quality data at Daring Lake, Desteffany Lake and Lac
de Gras. Lac de Gras and Desteffany show higher cumulative effects, mainly contributed by
anthropogenic disturbance in their sub-basin. The actual data supports the tool’s interpretation of
Desteffany Lake and Lac de Gras with a high number significant temporal trends and significant
increases in anthropogenic related parameters, such as strontium and conductance. Daring Lake is
predicted to have a low cumulative effect risk and its baseline data supports this with few temporal
trends and a lack of changing anthropogenic related parameters.

As outlined in Ecofish Research Ltd’s report, future work with the tool should include layers that
address permafrost thaw, slumping, and forest fires in the natural disturbance section and land cover
and surficial geology in the landscape vulnerability section (Ecofish et al., 2020). Considering that
section 1.0 of this report highlighted the significant effect geology, slumping, and forest fires can have
on water quality in the north, the tool should especially consider these. For example, the water
quality data showed significant increase in sodium (an indication of slumping) at Lac de Gras (419%)
and Desteffany Lake (174%) but is not directly accounted for by any of the tool’s layers. A more robust
surficial analysis by the tool may be helpful in teasing out sources of existing water quality
disturbances. Overall, the preliminary analysis of the cumulative effect index tool based on existing
water quality data shows agreement with observed data and potential as an effective predictive tool.
Moving forward, the three year sampling program in the Daring Lake sub-basin will help perfect this
tool further.
